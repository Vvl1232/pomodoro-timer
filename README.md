# Pomodoro Timer 🍅
This Python project implements a Pomodoro Timer using tkinter. The Pomodoro technique is a popular time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This timer has features like start, break, and reset functionality. Here’s a breakdown:

Main Components:
Labels: Display the timer, the title, and checkmarks for completed work sessions.
Buttons: To start the timer, take a break, and reset the timer.
Canvas: Used for displaying the countdown timer and a tomato image to represent the Pomodoro technique.

Color Scheme:
PINK: For short breaks
RED: For long breaks
GREEN: For work sessions
YELLOW: Background color

Timer Mechanism:
The timer works in cycles of work and break sessions.
There’s a special long break after every 8th work session.
You can start, pause, and reset the timer.

How to Use:
Click "Start" to begin a work session.
Click "Break" to manually start a short break.
Click "Reset" to reset the timer to 00:00 and clear any session progress.
Feel free to customize the constants like work, short break, and long break durations to suit your needs! ⏰💪
Happy productivity! 🚀
